# Fortnite-DBMS

This project aims to develop a Database Management System (DBMS) for Fortnite, a popular online multiplayer game. The system will manage various aspects of the game, including player information, match data, weapons, skins, challenges, and player statistics. The database schema includes tables such as Player, Match, Weapon, Skins, PlayerSkins, Challenges, PlayerChallenges, and PlayerMatchStats. These tables are interconnected through primary and foreign key relationships, allowing for efficient data retrieval and analysis. 

To visualize the database structure, an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram was created using Eraser.

Queries can be designed to extract valuable insights, such as player performance, popular weapons, and challenge completion rates. This DBMS will support various game features, including inventory management, player progression, and matchmaking, while also providing a foundation for data analytics to improve game balance and user experience.
